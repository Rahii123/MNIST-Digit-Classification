# MNIST Digit Classification ðŸŽ¯

This project trains machine learning models on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using:
- **SGDClassifier** (with hinge loss)
- **RandomForestClassifier**

It also deploys a **Gradio app** that lets you draw digits and predicts them.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Loads & preprocesses MNIST dataset
- Trains SGD and Random Forest models
- Evaluates with confusion matrix & classification report
- Error analysis
- Gradio web app for real-time digit recognition

## ðŸš€ How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/gradio_app.py
